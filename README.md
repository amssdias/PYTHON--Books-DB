# Books Database

This is a book database. There's 3 versions of this project. One the user will add the books and store them into a CSV file, other into a Json file and for last we will use a SQLite database.
In this project we will just use basic commands, such as add, update and delete books.

On my database project I have addded as well typing annotations to my database functions so it'll be easier to know what values to expect and created my own context manager using a class with dunder methods: `__enter__` and `__exit__` .
